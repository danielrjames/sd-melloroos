        While searching for a house in San Diego County, I realized there was no
        easy way to get exact Mello Roos taxes for properties I was interested
        in. Since these taxes do add up, it's nice to know what they are before
        making an offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a little digging, I found the steps needed to view this tax info
        to be somewhat cumbersome. And because of that, I decided to build this
        web app to automate that process. I hope it can get the information you
        need and please acknowledge that
        <strong>all data gathered by this application is public record</strong>,
        so if anything is off, take it up with the county. ðŸ¤£
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, if you like this app, I'm always available to hire for
        <i>little</i>
        projects like this. Feel free to contact me directly
